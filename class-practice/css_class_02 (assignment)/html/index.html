    <h1>The Rust Programming Language</h1>
    <p>by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols, with contributions from the Rust Community</p>


    <p>This version of the text assumes you’re using Rust 1.31.0 or later with edition="2018" in Cargo.toml of all projects to use Rust 2018 Edition idioms. See the <a href="file:///home/mrmjt/.rustup/toolchains/stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/share/doc/rust/html/book/ch01-01-installation.html">“Installation” section of Chapter 1</a>  to install or update Rust, and see the new <a href="file:///home/mrmjt/.rustup/toolchains/stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/share/doc/rust/html/book/appendix-05-editions.html">Appendix E</a>  for information on editions. </p>

    <p>The 2018 Edition of the Rust language includes a number of improvements that make Rust more ergonomic and easier to learn. This iteration of the book contains a number of changes to reflect those improvements: </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Chapter 7, “Managing Growing Projects with Packages, Crates, and Modules,” has been mostly rewritten. The module system and the way paths work in the 2018 Edition were made more consistent.
            </li>
        <li>Chapter 10 has new sections titled “Traits as Parameters” and “Returning Types that Implement Traits” that explain the new impl Trait syntax.
            </li>
        <li>Chapter 11 has a new section titled “Using Result<T, E> in Tests” that shows how to write tests that use the ? operator.
            </li>
        <li>The “Advanced Lifetimes” section in Chapter 19 was removed because compiler improvements have made the constructs in that section even rarer.
            </li>
        <li>The previous Appendix D, “Macros,” has been expanded to include procedural macros and was moved to the “Macros” section in Chapter 19.
            </li>
        <li>Appendix A, “Keywords,” also explains the new raw identifiers feature that enables code written in the 2015 Edition and the 2018 Edition to interoperate.
            </li>
        <li>Appendix D is now titled “Useful Development Tools” and covers recently released tools that help you write Rust code.
            </li>
        <li>We fixed a number of small errors and imprecise wording throughout the book. Thank you to the readers who reported them!
            </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that any code in earlier iterations of The Rust Programming Language that compiled will continue to compile without edition="2018" in the project’s Cargo.toml, even as you update the Rust compiler version you’re using. That’s Rust’s backward compatibility guarantees at work!
